MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
OF MONROE COUNTY, ILLINOIS APRIL 6, 2015
The meeting of the County Commissioners of Monroe County, Illinois was called to order at 8:00 a.m. Chairman Terry Liefer, Commissioner Delbert Wittenauer, and Commissioner Robert Elmore were present.
The meeting opened with the Pledge of Allegiance.
Others present included Sheila Wetzler, Linda Lehr and Deputy County Clerk Audrey Trembly, along with Press Corps representatives – Joe Leicht of the Monroe County Independent and Alan Dooley of the Republic Times.
There being a quorum present, meeting was called to order by Chairman Liefer.
Chairman Liefer said he would like to amend the agenda to include some discussion regarding various building issues with Brian Hooten.
Aaron Metzger was present to discuss Highway Department business. He said that it appears that the Governor would like to sweep $50 million from the State MFT funds, which would take a portion of the monthly allotment from each County.
Mr. Metzger said he asked Mayor Smith about the dirt area between the curb and the sidewalk around the Courthouse, and now the City may not be doing that. Commissioner Wittenauer said that’s not what he told me. Mr. Metzger said because of all of the other concrete work being done, they don’t know if they can afford that extra work. Mr. Metzger said he was just the messenger, and he will let the Commissioners discuss this with the City.
Mr. Metzger said he took the New Hanover traffic light situation to the County Planning Commission, and no action was taken, but numerous comments were offered. He said the feeling of the group was that they do not want multiple lights. Frontage roads were discussed, but there are some places where this would be a problem because of existing development. Mr. Metzger also discussed some potential projects and the comprehensive plan “wish list”.
Chairman Liefer asked if the Highway Department could assist with producing signage for the County Bicentennial Committee. Mr. Metzger said yes, they could do that if necessary.
Kevin Koenigstein came to the meeting to discuss various issues. The first item to be discussed was a Vacation Buy-Back Program. He said they started at November 30, 2014 and if the employee had vacation time on the books, they deducted 80 hours, and then to offer a premium to buy back the extra time from the employees. He said the maximum payout would be $170,000 at the current rate, if everybody with excess vacation time participated in the program. Commissioner Wittenauer asked if this was an optional program. Mr. Koenigstein said it would be voluntary on the part of the employees. Chairman Liefer said the idea would be to offer this program in July, and then include the actual numbers in the budget when that is prepared in the Fall, so it could be paid out next year. Mr. Koenigstein said paying a 5% premium over their current wages was also discussed to entice people to participate in the program. Chairman Liefer asked with the financial condition of the State of Illinois, do we want to include the opportunity to restrict the amount of payout if it would be detrimental to the financial status of the County. Commissioner Wittenauer said he felt we need to include that option since we are not sure what
78
MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
OF MONROE COUNTY, ILLINOIS APRIL 6, 2015
the financial situation will be. Chairman Liefer said he doesn’t feel that we’ll have 100% participation. Linda Lehr asked if this was a one-time offer. Chairman Liefer said as it stands right now, this is a one-time offer.
There was discussion regarding whether a limit should be put on the amount allowed for the buyback program. Commissioner Wittenauer said he would like to see this all cleaned up, but if the budget doesn’t allow, we may have to do it in multiple budget years. Chairman Liefer said do we want to offer this as the County will allow the entire vacation buyback request from the employee, or a portion thereof as the budget permits. There was some discussion as to whether everyone is complying with the vacation language in the new Handbook. Linda Lehr said the new Handbook was put into place in 2011. Mr. Koenigstein said the major amount of liability on the County’s books at this time is for sick leave. The County does not pay out sick leave at the time of retirement, but the employee is given IMRF credit for accrued sick time – the County only pays out for vacation time that is banked. Chairman Liefer asked Mr. Koenigstein if he could come back later in the meeting to continue the discussion.
Carla Heise was present to discuss Ambulance Service business. Ms. Heise presented the quarterly write-offs for the Ambulance Service. Motion was made by Commissioner Wittenauer, with a second by Commissioner Elmore to approve the Quarterly write-offs in the amount of $10,763.38. All voting Aye, none Nay and none Absent. Motion carried.
Ms. Heise said she wanted to let the board know that Medstar is increasing their wage rates for their employees, including a bonus for each year of experience. She said this will put Monroe County behind in the wages they pay their employees. Ms. Heise said from what she understands, and she has heard this from some of her employees, if someone goes to work for Medstar, they will be paid for their years of experience, even if they have worked for a different service.
Ms. Heise said she got a copy of the last day of training for Tritech. Chairman Liefer said he thinks we should go with the original agreement. Ms. Heise said she will send an invoice to Tritech, so they can pay the original amount agreed upon. Ms. Heise was instructed to prepare a bill, and give it to Kevin Koenigstein to forward on to Tritech. She said she will get everything together including the airfare, expenses, etc. and then forward it on to Kevin. Ms. Heise said that Tritech seems to be working well, and the crews are adjusting to it. She said the only problem is that the crews are used to typing their reports in capital letters, and then when they try to sign into Tritech that way it locks them out, and she has to unlock the system for them.
Chairman Liefer asked if we have been on the system for a week. Ms. Heise said they started with it last Wednesday. She said there are some minor problems, and some of it is just tweeking the verbage in the system to get it as close to what they were used to as possible and to what the State will accept. She said they are hoping this week to get the first 10 reports out, and every time you send them out, you have to pay for that, so they want to make sure it’s right. She said once they get them right, then they’ll do 100, because they have four months to do. Chairman Liefer said you have to do 10 first? Ms. Heise said they have to do 10 and get them approved, because they don’t want to have to look over 100. Once the first 10 go through, and you know what you’re doing, then you can submit the next 100. Chairman Liefer said so the first ten that have to be done, should be done already. Ms. Heise said no, this whole process, you have four months to do, and then I’m wondering if we shouldn’t get Code Red sent in first, because we
79
MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF THE BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
OF MONROE COUNTY, ILLINOIS APRIL 6, 2015
couldn’t do that until April 1. Ms. Heise said she was wondering if they should send Code Red in first before they send a different type in. She’s hoping they get that worked out this week, and there are people who do better reports, to do the ten that have to be submitted first.
Chairman Liefer said that’s true, but we don’t want to send in just the better ones, and then send the others in later. Ms. Heise said the better ones are the full-time staff, because they work on it daily. When you have a part-timer that’s just learning it, it might be the first time they’ve gone through it. Commissioner Wittenauer asked – isn’t there a full-timer always on duty? Ms. Heise said 99% of the time, yes, and I usually try to keep at least one full-timer on, but there are days when they’re not. Chairman Liefer said what is the breakdown regarding full-time and part-time - he said if there are 1000 hours spent, is it two-thirds versus one-third? Ms. Heise said yes, we have 10 full-timers, and 30 employees give or take, rounding to about 30 altogether. She said they are looking at hopefully hiring 5 more. Chairman Liefer said you’ve been working with Tritech for quite a while. Ms. Heise said we’ve been working with Tritech for billing for the last, as long as I’ve been here. Chairman Liefer said ten years. Ms. Heise said yes.
Chairman Liefer said with the changeover from a week ago, everything with the paramedics and all is different, but are you able to answer their questions and keep the system operational? Ms. Heise said yes, a lot of their questions are just program changes that are different from the way they did things previously – a lot of it is just simple stuff like that. She said when working with Tritech, one thing she and Gale brought up to Tritech last year that they hadn’t thought of was to be able to email the bills out to save money. Commissioner Wittenauer asked if there are any HIPAA problems with that. Ms. Heise said you would have to set up your system correctly to protect that information. She said if they send information to Memorial, it would be encrypted until they open it there.
Chairman Liefer said he knew that HIH is doing all of the cleanup of the prior and current system – have you been able to work with them? Ms. Heise said she took it over Friday, and from what she understands, the beginning and end of the month is busy for them, so she doesn’t know if they’ve looked at it yet. Commissioner Wittenauer said so you’ve been involved with them for a period of time, do you see them being an asset…where are we at on billing as of today – are we behind or ahead? Ms. Heise said we’re probably six weeks behind with that, they’re gonna have to put in. Commissioner Wittenauer said is there anything that is older than 6 weeks, that has not been billed? Ms. Heise said we have some that were sent to Medicare and rejected for some reason, but I don’t know how many are out there. She said those get taken care of as soon as they get back, so when it was sent over, all of those that were rejected would have been sent along, unless it is something that came in the last day or so. Ms. Heise said we handle rejections daily. Commissioner Wittenauer said as we move forward with HIH, do you see the workload coming off of you and Gale. Ms. Heise said some of it will, you’re adjusting what we’re doing. She said it will be nice that she won’t have to help Gale with checks anymore, and she can go back to what she was doing before Gale got behind. Ms. Heise said she would like to finish the HIPAA policy and things that she has not worked on.
Commissioner Wittenauer asked are you saying the HIPAA policy is not adequate? Ms. Heise said it’s adequate if they came in to check it, but your HIPAA policy is supposed to be reviewed every year, so now we have last year’s that she threw together quickly. Commissioner Wittenauer asked if there wasn’t a standard HIPAA policy that could be used. Ms. Heise said no,
80

OF MONROE COUNTY, ILLINOIS APRIL 6, 2015
she had purchased some reference material that helped her develop the policy. Commissioner Wittenauer said he guessed not all Counties have Ambulance Services, because that would be a good place for CIRMA to get involved. Ms. Heise said you could pay a lawyer to develop that – she has talked to Lowenbaum, and he has a HIPAA lawyer that would write one. She said HIPAA is an ongoing thing, the government makes changes regularly that you have to go and change.
Commissioner Wittenauer said our goal here is to maintain our Ambulance Service, because we’re proud of it, but we’re not making it financially – do you think this billing service will help to make the Ambulance Service financially stable, or you, as the Administrator of the Ambulance Service, how do we fix this thing? Commissioner Wittenauer said we are in the red with the Service every year, as the Administrator, what is your solution to that? Chairman Liefer said do you feel the changes being made will get us closer to where we need to be? Ms. Heise said with the billing service or doing the past billing? Commissioner Elmore said both, everything. Ms. Heise said with the billing service, possibly, they’re going to have a struggle, because they’ve never billed Ambulance Services, we don’t diagnose patients, so they can’t put that in when they bill – that’s not how we bill, that’s how Doctors bill, so for them that’s going to be a learning curve. She said she didn’t know how they were going to learn that – if it’s going to be rejections. Chairman Liefer said part of that is what he hopes Ms. Heise will work with the billing service to solve those problems. Ms. Heise said she told them when she dropped the things off, if you have any questions, call me – she said she hasn’t heard anything from them yet. She said they may not have started looking at it yet, but she has problem if they call and ask her questions. Ms. Heise said it’s going to be a learning curve for them, so hopefully after that they will have no problems. Chairman Liefer said Sherry and Jamie are going to work on this together to get things going.
Commissioner Wittenauer said our main challenge this year is our Ambulance Service, and we need to prioritize working with Carl to mend the budget. He said he doesn’t want to see it change, but one of these days we may have to make some hard decisions, so the billing service was one of the options to make this thing more efficient. He said if we hire a billing service, and we don’t save on hours and payroll, then what was the point? Chairman Liefer said he was lead to believe that Gale’s entire job was billing. Ms. Heise said it is, but when you’re outsourcing the billing, they don’t do the entire billing. She said when she talks about billing, that’s going through all the calls and getting them ready for billing, and that portion HIH doesn’t do, that’s still left on the Ambulance Service to do. Chairman Liefer said well, then maybe that’s something that needs to be discussed with HIH, his understanding was that the job of the billing service was to do everything, except on occasion there would be a missing signature or something. Ms. Heise said the signatures will be gathered like they always have been, when the crews are able to get them, they get them, and they’ve gotten very good about getting the signatures. Chairman Liefer said are some of these things that the crew should be doing, maybe when they’re sitting there in their down time, can they be doing some of this stuff? Ms. Heise said some of it, like getting it ready for billing, you’re going to have to teach them, technically from what Tritech is saying, it can go straight to billing, but then you’re sending things over there that the crews may not be done with, even if they don’t finish a report, that automatically goes right over. She said once our crews upload, that goes straight into the billing portion, whether the crews are done with it, whether it’s accurate, whether it needs any work done on it, it would go straight over, so someone’s going to have to go in and review.
81

OF MONROE COUNTY, ILLINOIS APRIL 6, 2015
Chairman Liefer said so Tritech is under the opinion that the crew should be able to write a report, and it should go straight to billing. Ms. Heise said well, I guess that’s their opinion. Chairman Liefer said you’re saying our crew isn’t doing that. Ms. Heise said it’s not just our
crews, it’s every crew, you still need to check to make sure everything is in there, if we have our HIPAA stuff for the Ambulance Service correct, that has nothing to do with billing. She said they can upload a report that doesn’t have a narrativeor has a partial narrative. Commissioner Elmore asked how this is corrected then. Ms. Heise said we would send it back to the crew member to finish if that’s what’s necessary, if it’s something we can do, we will fix it, but some stuff has to go back to the crew.
Chairman Liefer said Tritech feels, and they’ve been involved with Ambulance Services, our crew should be able to go out on the scene, write the report, and the report should be able to go to HIH without anybody else looking at it. Ms. Heise said yes, that is what they’re saying, we give it to a crew member to fix the next time they’re on, unless you want to pay a crew member to come in just to fix a report, or we could let them log on from a remote location, but she said she feels that would be a HIPAA violation. She said she doesn’t want them at home logging into the system. Commissioner Wittenauer asked how many errors are there? Ms. Heise said with switching the system, she is going to have to wait and see. Commissioner Wittenauer said with an easier system there should be less. Ms. Heise said there’s a learning curve, so for a while there could be more. Commissioner Wittenauer said if there’s a problem in the report, and it goes through billing, what happens? Ms. Heise said that would give us a liability, because we sent them a report that wasn’t ready to bill. Commissioner Elmore said doesn’t HIH check the report to make sure it’s correct before they send it in? Ms. Heise said that depends what they look at, as far as she knows, they are only checking three spots on the report before they submit it. She said they weren’t taught to do that, because it’s not a part of billing, it’s a part of the Ambulance Service.
Commissioner Wittenauer said what are the consequences if we do the reports wrong, if it costs us money, who is responsible, how much money in a year could that be? Ms. Heise said if Medicare comes and pulls a call, and finds some type of violation, there could be a $50,000 fine, and they’re expensive, and will start looking at every call to make sure it was done right. Commissioner Wittenauer said so we’re 100% right today. Ms. Heise said I don’t know if there’s a way to be 100% right, as long as you can justify you’re doing what you are supposed to be doing, there’s no other way to do it.
Commissioner Wittenauer said another thing – you help Gale, do you not? Ms. Heise said yes, when she was behind, I helped her try to catch up, but the HIPAA is not completely done, we still have to have spreadsheets of every computer and what’s on it, the serial numbers, all of that has to be recorded. Commissioner Wittenuaer said couldn’t you overview a lot of this anyway, if you were helping with billing, and billing is now gone…Ms. Heise said she only did a small portion of the billing work, I would pull the checks to get ready for her, or maybe at the end of the day she would pull something out. Commissioner Wittenauer said he thought that she handled checks and balances, and made sure that things were being handled correctly, and like errors by the crew, that would be something that you could handle. Ms. Heise said she can, but that would be putting more hours of work on her, if they only had two calls, it’s not a lot of work, but if they’ve had 20 calls, you’re looking at a couple hours worth of work to go through, and you can’t guess how many calls they have. Ms. Heise said yes, she could probably do a portion of it. Commissioner

OF MONROE COUNTY, ILLINOIS APRIL 6, 2015
Wittenauer said he thought we could get this fixed, that you could oversee it, and if something is really wrong, maybe there’s a way to fix it.
Commissioner Elmore said how about the missing information, is there an error message somewhere that tells you there is something not completed? Ms. Heise said there are certain tabs
that are defaulted so they have to enter information, so those are entered, the State ones are all defaulted. She said it could be time consuming, it could not be, right now it’s just a learning curve, she needs a couple weeks to see what all is involved. Chairman Liefer said we are learning too, and are trying to make this thing run better – he said you said you can review some of the bills going out, but the rest of the crew may not be able to because of HIPAA. Ms. Heise said technically you’re only supposed to look at your own report, the Supervisors can look at reports. Chairman Liefer said if there is a Supervisor on duty, why couldn’t that Supervisor review the reports? Ms. Heise said yes. Commissioner Wittenauer said well, that’s what we need to do. Ms. Heise said the problem with that is, they mess up on the billing section of it, because they don’t know billing, there are certain portions of that billing program that have to be filled out. She said maybe she needs to go over to the billing service to talk to them about it, too.
Chairman Liefer said you had a list of duties that you thought you were going to have to share or split out, but in a couple weeks we need to get everybody together, decide what needs to be done, and how the duties need to be split up. Ms. Heise said she’s kind of worked out with the Treasurer’s office what they want, they want reports once a week, but checks once a month. She said she will be sending information to HIH daily, but it will go weekly to the Treasurer’s office. Ms. Heise said all of the checks still come to the Ambulance Service, and HIH doesn’t accept any payments, but they will answer all questions that people may have about bills, Ms. Heise said HIH has also been given all of the prior billings with any notes about special circumstances. Chairman Liefer said hopefully Tritech will be a better system for keeping track of information. Ms. Heise said it definitely will be a better system.
Steve Huetsch and Stacey Asher came to the meeting to discuss the County’s Health Insurance program. Mr. Huetsch said they wanted to discuss medical claims, dental claims and some healthcare reform issues. Ms. Asher said the prescription drug claims were high for 2014 compared to the total medical claims, with the drug claims being 28% of the total claims. There was general discussion of the various options regarding drug plans for the County employees, as well as the medical claim information. Following that there was general discussion of the county’s dental claims. Ms. Asher discussed the mandatory reporting forms that will be required to comply with the Healthcare Reform legislation. Mr. Huetsch explained the details of the “Cadillac Tax” and how it will affect each employer. He said in many cases, the employers will be doing away with their FSA plans. There was also discussion about how to keep the price of the plan down as the insurance costs continue to rise. Mr. Huetsch said the unions are already discussing this, so the County will really need to watch this, and he said you are going to self-funding types of programs. Mr. Huetsch said the next time he comes to talk to the County Board, he would like to discuss preventive benefits.
Steve Huetsch and Stacey Asher left the meeting.

The bids for the proposed County telephone system were opened and reviewed. Also in attendance was Jon Schmalenberger of HTC. The bids were as follows –
HTC - $23,395.16
Avaya - $39,173.99
Fulton Communications - $24,913.80
Chairman Liefer said the bids would be reviewed for compliance with the equipment specifications.
Kevin Koenigstein returned to the meeting for further discussion. Chairman Liefer said he wanted to return to the vacation buyback discussion, and do we want to buy all of the vacation back if the employees request the complete available amount of $170,000. Mr. Koenigstein said you need to remember this would be coming from the County Contingency budget, and you could also consider spreading this program out over two years. He suggested to go ahead and roll out the program to see what kind of response we get. Commissioner Wittenauer said he feels we need to payout the entire amount, but we also need to maintain some flexibility just in case we have some budget problems in the future. Honoring the first $80,000 in requested buyback was discussed. Motion was made by Commissioner Elmore, with a second by Commissioner Wittenauer to approve payment of vacation buyback requests up to $80,000 during the current fiscal year, with payment by the end of 2015. All voting Aye, none Nay and none Absent. Motion carried. Commissioner Wittenauer said we need to make sure we put a deadline on the requests from the employees. It was suggested to start the enrollment period on July 1 with requests due by the first pay date in August. The Commissioners asked Linda Lehr to draft the letter that will be distributed to all employees regarding this program.
Kevin Koenigstein said the next order of business was regarding the real estate taxes to be collected to pay for the ICIT bonds. He said last year we abated the larger bond of $180,000 while keeping the smaller bond of $130,000 in place on the County’s tax levy. His suggestion was to again abate the larger bond, and keep the smaller bond assessment in place. Motion was made by Commissioner Wittenauer, with a second by Commissioner Elmore to abate the larger of the two bond levy requests, labeled as the ICIT A Bond payment, and to continue to levy for the ICIT B Bond payment. All voting Aye, none Nay and none Absent. Motion carried.
Mr. Koenigstein said the IMRF rate had peaked at 11.11 in 2012, and is now set at 9.34 for a preliminary rate for 2016. Monroe County is fully funded at a market basis.
The minutes of the previous meeting were approved upon motion by Commissioner Wittenauer, with a second by Commissioner Elmore. All voting aye, none nay and none Absent. Motion carried.
The following Accounts Payable having been approved for payment, Commissioner Wittenauer moved that the same be allowed and that vouchers be issued against their respective funds of the County Treasurer for payment. Motion seconded by Commissioner Elmore, and so declared all voting Aye, none Nay, and none Absent. Motion carried.

Linda Lehr reported that she will be meeting with the website developer on April 10. She said she has also prepared a draft insurance agreement for County-owned properties like the Baum Church site. Commissioner Wittenauer said all extra items on that agreement should be listed with the phrase “if available”.
Brian Hooten came to the meeting to discuss various maintenance issues. He said Dave Rick is going to do plastering repairs in the County Board room, and then County workers will repaint the room. Mr. Hooten said since the guttering repairs were made, there have been no leaks. Mr. Hooten asked if he could make arrangements to have service performed on all three generators. He said he got a bid from Gateway Industrial Power to service all three generators for a total cost of $1,911.52. He said this company can do a load bank on all three generators for the same price. He said Clifford Power bid the work at $1,951. Mr. Hooten said the generator has a tank of fuel that has probably been there for 30 years, and Clifford Power will do a fuel analysis. Chairman Liefer said he would not fill the fuel tanks until they are needed. Commissioner Wittenauer suggested emptying the tanks, and using the fuel somewhere else, and he suggested talking to the fuel supplier to get a recommendation on what to do. The Commissioners said they felt it made sense to go with the low bid of Gateway Industrial Power for the generator work.
Commissioner Wittenauer said he talked to the bricklayers on the generator project, and they are ready to go as soon as they get the brick. They would like to have the generator pulled out before they lay the brick, otherwise they will have to tarp it and be careful to keep it clean. Commissioner Wittenauer said since the generator is hard wired, someone would have to disconnect the electric to do that. It was decided to pull it out to accommodate the bricklayers.
Mr. Hooten said he got a bid from Trost Plastics to replace the chiller fence in an almond color, and he can cover it with his repair budget at a bid of $2,747. He will put sleeves in the ground so it can be removed later if the chiller ever needs to be replaced.
Mr. Hooten said he got bids on the prisoner fence for behind the Jail. The low bid was from All-Pro in the amount of $7,750 for the fenced enclosure including chain link fence over the top, plus a bid from Huebner for $2,250 for a concrete pad.
