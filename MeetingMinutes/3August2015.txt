Mr. Metzger said he is planning to do some microsurfacing to the stretch of former IL Route 156 from downhill Valmeyer to uphill Valmeyer because the current resurfacing has produced a very slick surface during Winter weather events. He said that the Commissioner for Road District No. 6 is also looking to do some resurfacing for maintenance purposes. Mr. Metzger decided to combine all of this work into one contract for 2.2 miles on the Route 156 portion and 1.6 miles on the Trout Camp Road portion. Motion was made by Commissioner Wittenauer, with a second by Commissioner Elmore to approve this project. All voting Aye, none Nay and none Absent. Motion carried.

Mr. Metzger said work continues on the Lakeview Drive project, and it appears that the State has started to do some curbing work related to the pending roundabout project.
Mr. Metzger said one of his employees was unable to get into the door at the Courthouse over the past weekend when they came in to work after hours. He said the swipe card worked on Saturday, but it did not work on Sunday, and the Dispatcher at the Jail knew nothing about having a spare card and helping the employee gain access to the building.
Linda Lehr said she is working on the Insurance census information, is working with Manav on the website and the County will be getting a work comp premium refund from CIRMA.
Jessica Gentry and Don Jones were present to discuss the Monroe-Randolph Transit District. Ms. Gentry said that ridership is up, especially in Monroe County. She said they have obtained the proper permits, and all vehicles can now cross into Missouri and St. Louis. Right now they are going there as trips are requested by riders, but she hopes in the future to establish designated routes and days for trips to St. Louis. Ms. Gentry distributed reports that detailed the budget for the district. She said the Federal funds are coming through as promised, but the State funds are not, and the majority of the funding for the district comes from the State. Ms. Gentry said that they have also had to deal with a $50,000 budget shortfall, because of a theft situation with one of the District employees.
Ms. Gentry said another problem with the budget is that the cost per mile to operate has gone up in 2015. She also provided a report showing the improvement in the performance of the District from the date it started to today. She said one benefit is that the cost of fuel has gone down to about $5,000 per month as compared to $12,000 per month during the time when fuel costs were the highest.
There was discussion of the support levels from Monroe and Randolph Counties. Chairman Liefer said that Randolph County said they no longer have the funds to assist the District. He also said that he talked to Kevin Day at State Bank, who reported that the Transit District line of credit is due now. Ms. Gentry said she was told by the Bank that the line of credit was not due until November. Commissioner Wittenauer said he also wanted to know if the line of credit was increased, and if so, he didn’t think the Monroe County Board had agreed to that.
Ms. Gentry said yes, the line of credit was increased, and it is now up to $210,000 and currently the District has drawn $190,000 against that line. Chairman Liefer said he was also unaware that the line of credit split between the Counties was one-third for Monroe County and two-thirds for Randolph County. Don Jones said there was a change of the way that State Bank was looking at the issue – previously they were considering the guarantees from the two Counties, but now they were only looking at the assets and collateral of the District for the line of credit guarantee. Ms. Gentry said she can use the vehicles purchased with District funds for collateral, but the vehicles that were given to the District by the State cannot be included as collateral.
Chairman Liefer said Ms. Gentry needs to contact State Bank to clarify this situation, and he said he would be doing the same after the meeting. Chairman Liefer said he would also be continuing his discussions with Randolph County so he knows their feelings on the issue.

Commissioner Wittenauer questioned a bill from Diane Frain for Human Resource services. Chairman Liefer said for some reason she wanted her bill split into three payments, so this was the last of those three payments. There was also some discussion of the payment for sheep that were attacked by dogs.
The following Accounts Payable having been approved for payment, Commissioner Elmore moved that the same be allowed and that vouchers be issued against their respective funds of the County Treasurer for payment. Motion seconded by Commissioner Wittenauer, and so declared all voting Aye, none Nay, and none Absent. Motion carried.

The minutes of the July 20 Regular Meeting and the July 23 Special Levee Meeting held at the Monroe County Fairgrounds were both approved upon motion by Commissioner Wittenauer, with a second by Commissioner Elmore. All voting Aye, none Nay and none Absent. Motion carried.
Chairman Liefer said he had received some report updates from East-West Gateway. He also said some repair work is being done on the Superintendent of Schools parking lot. Chairman Liefer reported that according to Treasurer Kevin Koenigstein, the tax bills will be going out some time later this month, with payments due in September and October.
Chairman Liefer reported that Kim Keckritz told him 10 new CNA’s have been hired at the Nursing Home.
Commissioner Wittenauer reported on the recent Monroe-Randolph County combined Levee District meeting.
Chairman Liefer reported that the new phone system has been installed, and it was determined that some additional switching equipment was required that Harrisonville Telephone Company had not been included in the original scope of work. He also reported that it appears that most of the County groups have now made arrangements to meet at the County Annex Building.
Chairman Liefer said he has been meeting with Mayor Smith regarding the situation with Western Egyptian suspending the meal program for Seniors. Chairman Liefer said that Kim Keckritz said she can help with food ordering and preparation, and their staff can also help with entertainment programming, but currently there is no extra space at the Nursing Home for this activity. Chairman Liefer said that Waterloo and Columbia may try to set up these services on their own. The Commissioners decided that for the time being all funding will be suspended for Western Egyptian, and as soon as the County Board sees how other entities reinstitute these

services, those funds may be used to help with funding the Senior programs by the Cities or other groups in the County.
There was some discussion regarding the possible increase in some of the Court/Sheriff-related fees. Dennis Knobloch said that it was his understanding that Sheriff Rohlfing was supposed to be checking whether these fees could be increased without doing a fee study.
Commissioner Wittenauer initiated some discussion regarding the computation of tax rates.
There being no further business to come before the Board, motion to adjourn was made by Commissioner Elmore, with a second by Commissioner Wittenauer. All voting Aye, none Nay and none Absent. Motion carried.
